**Reminders** is a VS Code extension that allows you to create callbacks directly from the IDE.

## Usage

1. Install the extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrdoomy.reminders) ;
2. Add a new reminder (see *Key Bindings* section) ;
3. Show all reminders (by clicking on the status bar item) ;
4. Wait... If your reminder contains the pattern `12am`, `6pm`, `20:45` or `8h15`, it will be displayed in due time !
5. Also you can clear all reminders, or close and re-open your IDE for wiping the list.

**Enjoy !** =)
